Omega
=====

The Omega project/tool is a lightweight GUI tool, developed by senior admins, to be used by those less familiar with PowerShell as a means of executing basic server management and reporting tasks from a single, easy to use, console. Almost all commands executed by any button, or report, are rooted from PowerShell.

PowerShell Studio 2014 was used as the IDE and is required to edit/compile any of the source files, however, they are still readable in raw format if you wish to extract code and use. Sapien does offer a trial at http://www.sapien.com/software/powershell_studio
